Part of building software is the feedback loop of knowing what you create works
or not. There are multiple aspects of working software, ranging from technically
working to accepted by users as software built as expected.

This project aims at providing build pipelines that can build, quality assure,
automate testing, automate security and vulnerabilities checks.
